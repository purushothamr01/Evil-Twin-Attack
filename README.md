ESP8266 Wi-Fi Deauthentication and Evil Twin Attack Code


Code Attribution
This code was developed by myself as part of a project exploring Wi-Fi security, specifically the deauthentication attack and Evil Twin attack. While I wrote the code, I also conducted research online to understand the technical aspects of these attacks and the ESP8266 Wi-Fi programming. Several resources, tutorials, and documentation were consulted during the development process to ensure proper implementation and optimization.
